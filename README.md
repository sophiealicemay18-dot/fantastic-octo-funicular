Project Closing
This article will teach you about the closing phase or process group. Unlike other phases, this process is singular and is named ‚Äúclose project or phase.‚Äù 

The closing process begins when the project team produces a deliverable, the quality control team inspects the deliverable, and the project manager verifies the deliverable as meeting specifications from the project management plan. 

The project team completes the closing phase input and outputs for all deliverables. The key inputs required to begin the closing phase are: 

The project charter, which defines the objectives of the project. The objectives drive project planning and execution. Project managers evaluate deliverables against what the project charter describes to ensure no omissions or gaps. 

Business documents such as the benefits management plan and business case which describe the project‚Äôs anticipated benefits. The project manager assesses whether the final project has delivered the intended benefits. 

The project manager ensures fulfillment of all contract deliverables and settlement of final payments, and no actions remain. 

An authorized agent accepts the deliverables. Possible authorized agents include the sponsor, the manager, the client, the customer, or the user. 

Once the project team fulfills the input requirements, the project manager focuses on the outputs of the phase, which include: 

The final product transition, the most crucial product or service handoff. The customer accepts the product or service, which is now their responsibility. 

The final report is an overview of what the project team plans to create versus what they produce. If there are gaps or omissions, the project manager must address them. This report is also an excellent opportunity to thank and praise the team. 

Lessons learned are critical, as lessons learned provide information to help future projects succeed. 


Key roles and responsibilities of the project manager
The roles and responsibilities of the project manager during the closing phase include: 

Staying in constant contact with those who must accept the final product or service and identifying and addressing issues when they occur. 

Being aware of what success looks like and constantly searching for deviations that may result in non-conformance and a lack of fitness for use. 

Ensuring the capability of the subject matter experts who understand the nature of contract deliverables and can perform effective vendor management for the project. 

Beginning to plan the product or service transition on day one of the project. The project manager should identify who will accept the transitioned product or service and ensure the acceptor is part of the project planning and execution phases. 

Performing a variance analysis and knowing what the project means to produce. The project manager must have an inventory of what the project team produces and address any variances as the next steps. 

Conducting lessons learned. 

The Importance of Lessons Learned 
The project manager should conduct and document lessons learned after each completed project phase or within implementation of a process when it makes sense. The Project Management Institute (PMI) states that the primary value of lessons learned is to provide information to help future projects be successful. History repeats itself. Lessons learned ensure that good history repeats itself or reduces the risk of bad history recurring. 

The project manager leads lessons learned, and the project team and stakeholders respond to three questions: 

What went well? 

What could go better? 

How can we improve?

The PMI recommends that the organization create a lessons learned register, a document the project manager posts in a shared location such as Microsoft Teams or Microsoft SharePoint. The lessons learned from multiple projects are available to select managers and team members to review. 

A second recommendation from the PMI is that the project manager assigns each improvement idea to a team member. This team member is responsible for executing the improvement idea. The project manager logs the responsible team member and improvement idea into the lessons learned register. 

Conclusion 
Project managers must be able to summarize the importance of the project closing phase, including the key inputs and outputs that occur. Project managers should communicate with those who accept the deliverables, be aware of what a successful finished project looks like, and conduct lessons learned with the project team after the project. Lessons learned prompt the stakeholders and project team to determine what went well, what could go better, and how they could improve to ensure the success of the future project.

Lab: Why Projects Fail
Estimated duration: 15 minutes
Objective
Identify the reasons for project failure
Prerequisites
You must have Microsoft Office or Microsoft 365 apps installed on your computer or have access to the free web version of Microsoft 365.

Scenario: Inventory Management System Upgrade Project
Sunil is an operations manager. He has had little project management training. However, when his manager, Ram insisted, Sunil accepted the project manager role for an inventory management system upgrade project. The aim of this project was to replace an outdated inventory management system that involved several manual steps with a new automated system. As a project manager, Sunil was tasked with the objective to manage the software upgrade and develop automated solutions to eliminate the manual steps. The team finished the work; however, it was three weeks behind time and 25% over budget.
When the project started, Ram, had asked Sunil to do his best. However, this work went above and beyond what he normally did in operations. Ram was the project sponsor and based on time constraints, Ram and Sunil agreed to forego the Project Charter process and use their conversation as the basis to move the project forward.
Ram was not exactly sure about the time and cost expectations for the system upgrade when Sunil was assigned. Ram had made a commitment to the management to complete the project in two months. He also estimated that the project would not exceed $25k. He based this estimate on the best information he had available at the time. Ram's assessment, however, was based on what he knew rather than on data. Ram stated he would work with Sunil on the project to determine the exact requirements. Ram consistently shared new information with Sunil as the project entered the planning and execution phases.
Sunil initially tried to perform all project tasks by himself. He soon realized that this project was far more than he could handle on his own. In addition, Sunil also realized that he needed a Subject Matter Expert for support. Ram did his best to find other resources to help Sunil as the project progressed.
Priya and Alex were assigned to the project two weeks after it started. Alex was an innovator. He worked tirelessly to develop new automated solutions and would reveal his work to the rest of the team periodically. Priya was a process manager. It took some time, but she was able to address some issues that caught the team by surprise that were not anticipated at the beginning of the project.
Halfway through the project, Alex stumbled upon an alternative software solution that was better than what was originally planned. The software was more expensive but provided far more functionality than the original software that had been planned. Priya and Alex worked hard to develop solutions. They acquired the software, updated the system, and automated many prior manual steps in the process.
When the final solution was provided, Ram had some questions and proposed some modifications. In the end, the project was completed. But it was completed behind schedule, and the proposed budget for the project was exceeded.

Module 1 Summary and Highlights: The Project Management Lifecycle
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know: 

The different types of project lifecycles, including predictive and adaptive methods. 

A brief overview of adaptive lifecycles and critical artifacts. 

The project management institute (PMI) employs crucial processes with each of the five phases or process groups in a predictive lifecycle. 

The project manager's roles and responsibilities during the project management lifecycle's initiating, planning, executing, and monitoring and controlling phases. 

Development of the project charter and a stakeholder register occurs during the initiating phase, and the project manager presents these documents to a project sponsor for approval. 

In the project planning phase, the project manager develops a comprehensive project management plan and presents it to a sponsor for approval. Then the project manager schedules a kick-off meeting and gains stakeholder acceptance of the plan. 

The development of the project deliverables occurs during the executing phase and the skills a project manager must have for a successful execution phase. 

The project manager verifies that completed deliverables meet project management plan specifications during the monitoring and controlling phase. The project team presents the deliverables to a customer for acceptance. 

In the project closing phase, the project manager ensures all deliverables meet specifications, attains final customer acceptance, and transitions the final product or service to the customer. The project manager also presents a final report during this phase, and the project team conducts and shares lessons learned.
